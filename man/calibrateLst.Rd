\usage{
calibrateLst(respDfLst = NULL, keyDfLst, pid, n_cov, run)
}
\arguments{
\item{respDfLst}{List of response dataframe. Default is NULL (reruns after review).
If NULL and items need collapsing, put processed data with test name in
'data' folder before running.}

\item{keyDfLst}{List of key dataframes. Element names are test names.}

\item{n_cov}{Number of covariates before responses.}

\description{
This function calibrates a list of tests and put results into a summary file
in 'results' folder with 'itn' and run number in name. Make sure elements in keyDfLst
and respDfLst (if not NULL) in same order correspond to one test.
Also, keyDfLst should have test name for each element.
