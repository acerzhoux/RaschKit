\arguments{
\item{test}{Name of the test.}

\item{respDf}{Dataframe with pid, covariables (e.g,, DIF variable), and
responses. Default is NULL where Excel file with name 'test' in 'data'
folder is used.}

\item{keyDf}{Dataframe of 'Item', 'Key', 'Max_score', 'Key2' (if 2 keys),
'Key3' (if 3 keys) ...}

\item{pid}{Name of candidates' ID variable.}

\item{n_cov}{Number of covariates before responses.}

\item{regrNmVec}{Vector of character regressors' names.}

\item{nDimVec}{Vector of numbers of responses the dimensions have.
Default is NULL. Define this vector if multi-dimensional model is to be run,
e.g., c(30, 45). Also should define this if there are variables after
response columns, e.g., 30.}

\item{dimNmVec}{Vector of the dimensions' names. Default is NULL.
Define this vector if multi-dimensional model is to be run.}

\item{quick}{TRUE if empirical error is not needed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{trial}{TRUE when trial item diagnostics is needed after anchoring is done.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{section_extr}{Extra sections to be added to 'test.cqc' file in
'input' folder. Default is NULL.}

\item{easy}{Threshold to flag easy items. Default is 90 (percent correct).}

\item{hard}{Threshold to flag hard items. Default is 10 (percent correct).}

\item{iRst}{Threshold to flag low item-rest correlation statistics.
Default is 0.11.}

\item{fit_w}{Threshold to flag large weighted item fit statistics.
Default is 1.1.}

\item{fit_uw}{Threshold to flag large unweighted item fit statistics.
Default is 1.2.}

\item{dFallThr}{Ability on last bin above which falling distractor is flagged.
Default is 0.5.}

\item{dRiseThr}{Ability on last bin below which rising distractor is unflagged.
Default is 0.1.}

\item{numAbilGrps}{Number of ability groups. Default is NULL.}

\item{missCode2Conv}{Response codes to convert to embedded/trailing missing
('M' or 'R'). Use freq_resps_cat() to explore response distribution
and determine which codes need recoding. Commonly found missing symbols
are '@' (less or more), 7, 8, 9, 88, 99, '.', '-', '', NA. Default is NULL
when responses have been recoded.}

\item{filetype}{Format for input dataset. Default is 'sav'. Also support
csv format.}

\item{slope}{Slope to multiply ability estimates. Default is NULL}

\item{intercept}{Value/intercept to add to ability estimates. Default is NULL.}

\item{extrapolation}{Whether to extrapolate the minimum and maximum estimates.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{save_xlsx}{Whether to save summary file. Default is TRUE (single test).}

\item{est_type}{Type of ability estimate to use for score equivalence table,
'wle' or 'mle'. 'wle' is commonly used. Default is NULL (equiv table not needed).}

\item{sparse_check}{Whether to check response column sparsity in general or
regarding any DIF variable category. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, sparse
response columns will be removed.}

\item{CCCip2Wd}{TRUE if to save CCC and item-person map to a Word file. Default
is FALSE.}

\item{pweight}{Variable name of person weights in response dataframe. Should
be specified if weight is used for modeling. Default is NULL.}

\item{ancShift}{Shift of mean anchor delta from previous cycle obtained from
equating analysis. It will be added to each item delta of 'test' in 'output'
folder and put in 'input' folder as anchor file for 'test'. Default is NULL.}

\item{ancTest2Read}{Name of test in 'output' folder to read delta from. This
is usually concurrent calibration results such as all grades and/or all test
forms. Only delta's (and step estimates) in 'tests' are extracted and put in
'input' folder as anchor file. Default is NULL.}

\item{ancDf}{Dataframe of 'Item' and 'Delta' for anchors. Include 'Step' column
for step estimates (step number). Default is NULL. Check output 'xxx_anc.txt' file
from previous run for correct anchor order, especially for polytomous items
with step parameters.}

\item{ancRead}{Whether to read anchor file in 'input' folder. Need to put anchor
file there. Default is FALSE.}

\item{useR}{TRUE when code 'R' is used for scoring. Default is FALSE.}
}
\description{
This function calibrates items in a test and adds comments and flags of
levels of priority for review. This is associated with test named 'test'.
If save_xlsx is TRUE, an Excel file with a summary of the above information
will be saved in 'results' folder in the working directory.

# Not run
