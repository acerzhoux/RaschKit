\usage{
equate2Type(
  linkTypeLst,
  test,
  p_cut = 0.05,
  DIF_cut = 0.5,
  DIF_std_cut = 4,
  step = FALSE,
  iter = TRUE,
  sigma = FALSE,
  run
)
}
\arguments{
\item{linkTypeLst}{Length-one list such as list(Hrz=list(grades=c(2:10),
forms=c('A', 'B', 'C'))) or list(Vrt=c(2:10)). Name is Hrz or Vrt.
Element is list of grades and test forms or vector of grades.}

\item{test}{Name of test.}

\item{p_cut}{p value of chi-square test. Default is 0.05.}

\item{DIF_cut}{Threshold of an item's delta estimate difference between two
tests. Default is 0.5.}

\item{DIF_std_cut}{Threshold of an item's standardized delta estimate difference
between two tests. Default is 4.}

\item{step}{TRUE if DIF analysis is performed on step parameters.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{TRUE to iteratively remove DIF items. Default is TRUE}

\item{sigma}{Indicator of how 'delta.y' is scaled. If TRUE, it is scaled
to have same mean and sd as 'delta.x'. If FALSE, it has same mean as 'delta.x'.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{run}{String that indicates run such as 'pre_review' and 'post_review'.}
}
\value{
List of chi-square test results for anchors between two adjacent grades.
}
\description{
This function performs vertical equating. An Excel file named 'Vrt_xxx.xlsx'
is saved in 'equating' folder, each sheet of which is for two
adjacent grades Also saved are scatterplots named 'Vrt_xxx.pdf'.
}
\examples{
equate2Type(list(Hrz=list(grades=NULL, forms=c('B', 'C', 'D'))), 'OPRA')
