Open this .Rmd file via 'xxx.Rproj' in working directory.
Select function below for different cases. Functions would output instructions 
on where to find report and/or result files.

Prepare dataframe dfAnc as 'dfAnc' argument of calibrate(). It has variables
  - Item: item labels.
  - Delta: anchor estimates.  
  
If you're using an xxx_anc.txt file from previous run, copy that file from 'output'
  folder into 'input' folder and set dfAnc=NULL. 

Note that anchors' logit difficulty estimates in Column 'Delta' would be used to 
anchor current cycle/run's items and candidates onto previous cycle/run. 
Also produced are equivalence table and anchored ability estimates.

```{r}
# Set 'anchor' as TRUE to do anchoring
calibrate(anchor=TRUE, test='FPA', pid='pid', n_cov=1, keys=keys, dfAnc=dfAnc)
```
